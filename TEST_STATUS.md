# Test Status Tracker

## Worked on Tests
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/DatabaseService.test.ts` — PASS — Covers init sequencing, getter guards, and proxy methods with dependency-injected doubles; reads as high quality and still aligned with current surface area.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/DatabaseService.errors.test.ts` — PASS — Realistic mocks exercise error paths, transactional propagation, and bulk query guardrails; remains a solid regression net.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/services/DatabaseService.integration.test.ts` — PASS — End-to-end verification across Postgres/Falkor/Qdrant/Redis surfaced missing `Entity` graph label and JSONB handling; label fix documented under `Docs/Blueprints/knowledge-graph-service.md`.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/KnowledgeGraphService.test.ts` — PASS — Exercise full entity lifecycle with rich mocks; assertions stay aligned with current API surface and remain high quality despite verbose fixture logging.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/KnowledgeGraphService.noise.test.ts` — PASS — Focused gating check for inferred relationships; concise and still relevant after confidence threshold tweaks.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/KnowledgeGraphService.impact.test.ts` — PASS — Validates composite impact aggregation across symbols, tests, docs, and specs; scenarios mirror production usage and remain high fidelity.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/services/KnowledgeGraphService.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Added defensive entity cleanup before relationship fixtures so duplicates are not carried between cases; highlights missing `TestIsolationContext` wiring in the service (see blueprint note).
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/PostgreSQLService.test.ts` — PASS — Broad coverage across initialization, query/transaction/bulk flows, and defensive UUID validation keeps the suite high quality; mocks stay realistic via injected pools and type parsers.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/services/PostgreSQLService.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Exercises schema setup, CRUD, transactions, analytics history, and load/error scenarios against live Docker services; tests remain representative and surfaced only environment readiness gaps (docker services must be started via `pnpm docker:test-up`).
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/SynchronizationCoordinator.test.ts` — PASS — Extensive happy-path and edge-case coverage (queueing, cancellation, partial/incremental modes) continues to read as high value; mocks remain realistic though the log stream is verbose.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/SynchronizationCoordinator.resolver.test.ts` — PASS — Resolver helpers stay deterministic and provide good signal on relationship target resolution; compact but meaningful.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/services/SynchronizationCoordinator.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Full-stack sync exercises (full/incremental/partial/conflict flows) now complete without Falkor map errors after sanitizer fix; still emits expected embedding warnings when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is absent (documented in the synchronization blueprint).
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/DocumentationParser.test.ts` — PASS — Revalidated heuristics-driven parsing across Markdown/RST/AsciiDoc; signal extraction continues to surface business domains and locales without regression.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/services/DocumentationParser.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Cross-service ingest/search against Docker Postgres/Falkor/Qdrant/Redis still succeeds; section linkage and relationship freshness remain healthy.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/api/routes/graph.test.ts` — PASS — Exercised new `buildErrorResponse` helper to guarantee graph endpoints emit `requestId`/`timestamp` metadata on server failures; aligned expectations with symbol-kind filters; captured follow-up in `Docs/Blueprints/api-error-handling.md`.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/api/APIGateway.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Gateway now returns consistent error envelopes (code/message/details plus request metadata) when graph search fails, restoring parity with logging and client expectations; blueprint noted under `Docs/Blueprints/api-error-handling.md`.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/SecurityScanner.test.ts` — PASS — Extensive coverage across scan orchestration, rule loading, monitoring config, and database interactions; tests remain high quality despite verbose mocks and validate resilience to errors like malformed package manifests.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/SecurityScanner.issues-suppression.test.ts` — PASS — Focused suppression rule matching scenarios stay tightly scoped and continue to reflect current suppression semantics.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/services/SecurityScanner.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Full-stack security ingest across Falkor/Qdrant/Postgres/Redis continues to validate scan orchestration and persistence; bootstrap now provisions unique constraints via `GRAPH.CONSTRAINT` with index preflight and only falls back when engines lack support (tracked in `Docs/Blueprints/security-relationships.md`).
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/LoggingService.test.ts` — PASS — Restored `getLogStats` alias fields (`byLevel`/`byComponent`) so downstream analytics no longer break; suite remains thorough though it still lacks teardown coverage for global console/process hooks (documented in `Docs/Blueprints/logging-service.md`).
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/services/LoggingService.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Confirmed stats contract end-to-end, but runs surface noisy recursion when file writes fail and accumulating process listeners; instrumentation gaps logged under `Docs/Blueprints/logging-service.md` for follow-up.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/BackupService.test.ts` — PASS — Realigned suite with storage-provider abstractions, restore token requirements, and retention pruning by injecting an in-memory provider and stubbed metadata; surfaces that retention verification still depends on stubbed DB responses (integration coverage noted in `Docs/Blueprints/maintenance-operations.md`).
- 2025-09-19: `tests/unit/services/ConflictResolution.test.ts` — PASS — Smoke check reaffirmed deterministic resolution logic and mocks remain aligned; no adjustments needed beyond documenting the existing concurrency fixtures.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/services/BackupService.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Updated to honour the preview/token restore flow and structured PostgreSQL artifacts; fixed implementation now emits JSON+schema dumps and restores via parametrised inserts (blueprint refreshed under `Docs/Blueprints/maintenance-operations.md`). Tests remain high value after adding recursive artifact helpers and corruption assertions.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/models/entities.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Full cross-database lifecycle coverage (Postgres/Falkor/Qdrant/Redis) continues to hold up; warnings logged during error-path assertions remain intentional to verify recovery branches, so no implementation changes required.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/api/AdminRestore.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Realigned integration flow with the preview/confirm restore pipeline, exercising Fastify schema validation responses plus token issuance/execution against live BackupService; coverage now matches documented two-step recovery process.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/api/EndToEnd.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Updated dependency/examples expectations to mirror 200 + empty payload semantics and hardened `TestEngine.getCoverageAnalysis` so coverage requests for non-test entities return zeroed metrics instead of 500s; suite again validates full-stack workflows without masking regressions.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/api/MCPToolIntegration.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Full MCP tool suite still green; confirmed tools surface consistent envelope metadata and exercise real KG persistence without needing additional adjustments.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/api/Middleware.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Re-run validated rate limiting, request-size, timeout, and concurrent load middleware remain stable against live services with consistent structured error envelopes.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/api/RESTEndpoints.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Full REST surface (graph, design, impact, code, docs) stayed green; no spec drift detected while exercising live KG/Qdrant/Postgres integrations and response metadata.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/api/SourceControlManagement.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Documented 501 `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` responses for commit/PR automation and now assert the structured error envelope instead of assuming real SCM orchestration; created follow-up blueprint for future implementation.
- 2025-09-19: `tests/integration/api/TRPC.integration.test.ts` — PASS — Brought notification expectation in line with current JSON-RPC acknowledgement shape (200 + `{ jsonrpc: '2.0', result: { ok: true } }`) while keeping the rest of the suite green.
