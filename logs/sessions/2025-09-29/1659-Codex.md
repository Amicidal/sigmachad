Task & Definition
- Updated `TODO.md` project snapshot and engagement checklist for Neo4j/Nx adoption and reorganized docs; scanned repo for additional context cues per request.

Constraints/Risks
- Workspace-write sandbox with restricted network; high-output test commands must be log-redirected (not needed today); Nx monorepo depth/import limits noted.

Code Searches
- `sed -n '1,200p' TODO.md` – reviewed existing snapshot/checklist wording.
- `ls`, `cat package.json`, `cat nx.json`, `sed -n '1,200p' docker-compose.yml`, `rg "neo4j" -n`, `rg "qdrant" -n` – mapped active services, dependencies, and remaining FalkorDB references; confirmed Neo4j usage across apps/scripts.
- `ls Docs`, `ls Docs/Guides`, `ls Docs/Blueprints`, `sed -n '1,160p' Docs/Guides/README.md` – validated documentation reorganization into guides/blueprints/enhancements.

Web Searches
- None.

Implementation Notes
- Edited `TODO.md` project snapshot to highlight Nx-managed structure, Neo4j-based graph store, updated module list, reorganized doc entry points, and current toolchain (see TODO.md lines 9-22).
- Revised engagement checklist to steer setup toward Neo4j/Postgres/Redis services, Nx commands, and new documentation paths while flagging legacy FalkorDB references (see TODO.md lines 24-33).

Validation Evidence
- Manual review of updated sections via `sed -n '1,120p' TODO.md`; no automated tests applicable.

Open Follow-ups
- None.

Task & Definition
- [2025-09-29T17:03Z] Updated Docker targets and test compose stack to run Neo4j/Postgres/Redis for local and CI flows per user request.

Constraints/Risks
- Keep port mappings (Neo4j 7688/7475, Qdrant 6335/6336, Postgres 5433, Redis 6381) free to avoid conflicts with existing services.

Code Searches
- `rg "FalkorDB"` – located remaining references to replace in compose/command targets.
- `sed -n '1,200p' docker-compose.test.yml` – verified updated Neo4j service definition and health checks.

Web Searches
- None.

Implementation Notes
- Adjusted `project.json` docker commands to spin up Neo4j/Postgres/Redis via `docker compose` (see project.json lines 37-55).
- Rewrote `docker-compose.test.yml` to provision `neo4j-test` (community image, APOC plugin) alongside existing Qdrant/Postgres/Redis services (see lines 1-73).

Validation Evidence
- Manual diff review with `git diff docker-compose.test.yml project.json` confirming target and service updates.

Open Follow-ups
- Consider refreshing `tests/README.md` and other FalkorDB references to reflect the Neo4j-based test stack.
Task & Definition
- [2025-09-29T17:13Z] Refreshed Neo4j stack messaging across tests and docs, updated test utilities/config scripts, and pruned remaining FalkorDB references where compatible.

Constraints/Risks
- Existing code contracts still expose `falkordb*` methods for backwards compatibility; renaming them would cascade across packages. Large pre-existing repo diffs require careful targeting of edits.

Code Searches
- `rg --files-with-matches "FalkorDB"` – enumerated remaining references to prioritize doc/test updates.
- `sed -n '1,200p' tests/README.md` – reviewed outdated FalkorDB setup instructions.
- `rg "FALKORDB_URL"` – located environment variable documentation and scripts that needed Neo4j equivalents.
- `rg "falkorGraph" tests/test-utils/database-helpers.ts` – prepped field renames to graph-agnostic terminology.

Web Searches
- None.

Implementation Notes
- Updated `tests/README.md` manual setup/env guidance to Neo4j (`bolt://localhost:7688`), refreshed coverage sections, and renamed sections to “Neo4j Operations”.
- Reworked `tests/test-utils/database-helpers.ts` to configure `DatabaseConfig.neo4j`, renamed graph fixture fields, and clarified legacy Falkor command wrappers now delegating to Neo4j.
- Renamed fixture identifier collections to `graphEntities` across integration tests and docs to remove Falkor-specific naming.
- Replaced docker/test docs and environment sections (project snapshot, TODO_STATE.json, Docs/MementoArchitecture.md, Docs/Guides/memento-architecture.md, Docs/Brainstorm.md) with Neo4j-specific details and credentials.
- Swapped `scripts/clear-knowledge-graph.js` implementation to use the Neo4j driver instead of Redis/Falkor commands and updated environment docs in `apps/main/src/index.ts`.

Validation Evidence
- Manual inspection via `sed`/`rg` for updated files (`tests/README.md`, `tests/test-utils/database-helpers.ts`, `docker-compose.test.yml`, `Docs/MementoArchitecture.md`). No automated tests executed (documentation/config only).

Open Follow-ups
- Consider authoring a migration plan to rename remaining `falkordb*` APIs once dependents are ready (e.g., DatabaseService interfaces, backup routines).EOF
