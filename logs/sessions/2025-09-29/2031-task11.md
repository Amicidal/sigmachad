### Task & Definition
Execute Task 2025-09-29.11: remove FalkorDB-specific artifacts from all test suites, aligning mocks and fixtures with current Neo4j/Postgres abstractions so test TypeScript compiles cleanly.
### Constraints/Risks
Respect monorepo depth and package boundary rules; avoid disturbing unrelated WIP; ensure replacements leverage shared types; redirect verbose logs; network access restricted.
### Code Searches
Pending.
### Web Searches
None.
### Implementation Notes

### Open Follow-ups

### Task & Definition
Begin removing FalkorDB-specific test utilities and updating DatabaseService unit suites to use Neo4j abstractions.
### Constraints/Risks
Extensive downstream tests still depend on Falkor naming; risk of partial migrations causing type errors. Qdrant mocks no longer injectable via DatabaseService factories, so temporary manual injection used; requires follow-up cleanup.
### Code Searches
- `rg "RealisticFalkor" tests` → Identified remaining Falkor mock usages in unit suites.
- `rg "falkorFactory" tests` → Highlighted dependency injection rename points needing updates.
### Web Searches
None.
### Implementation Notes
- Replaced Falkor-specific mocks with Neo4j equivalents in `tests/test-utils/realistic-mocks.ts`, adding vector API coverage to satisfy `INeo4jService` contract.
- Rewrote `tests/unit/services/DatabaseService.test.ts` and `DatabaseService.errors.test.ts` to use new Neo4j mocks, updated dependency injection, and exercised `graphQuery`/`graphCommand` flows.
- Began refactoring `tests/unit/services/BackupService.test.ts` for Neo4j mocks; manually injected `qdrantService` to preserve coverage pending a dedicated factory hook.
### Validation Evidence
Not yet executed; pending broader Falkor removal to avoid partial type-check noise.
### Open Follow-ups
- Update remaining test suites (`ConfigurationService`, `SecurityScanner`, `RollbackCapabilities`, etc.) to drop Falkor interfaces.
- Run `pnpm exec tsc -p tsconfig.test.json --noEmit` after all suites migrate.
- Consider adding DatabaseService Qdrant factory for cleaner test injection.
