### Task & Definition
Audit Task 2025-09-29.10 to confirm whether all test files avoid deep relative imports (three or more `../`) and determine if acceptance criteria are met.
### Constraints/Risks
Must honor monorepo depth policy and avoid modifying unrelated in-progress work; evaluation relies on TypeScript sources under `tests/`.
### Code Searches
None yet.
### Web Searches
None.
### Implementation Notes
None.
### Validation Evidence
Pending audit results.
### Open Follow-ups
None.

### Task & Definition
Continuing verification effort for Task 2025-09-29.10; no scope change.
### Constraints/Risks
Same constraints as prior entry; no new risks identified.
### Code Searches
- `rg -n "(\.\./){3,}" tests` â†’ No matches; suggests no test import paths contain three or more `../` segments.
### Web Searches
None.
### Implementation Notes
No code modifications required at this stage.
### Validation Evidence
Absence of matches in the `rg` search indicates compliance with depth rule across `tests/` TypeScript files.
### Open Follow-ups
None.

### Task & Definition
Verification complete; preparing summary for Task 2025-09-29.10.
### Constraints/Risks
No additional risks; guard extension should succeed with zero new violations based on audit.
### Code Searches
No new searches beyond prior `rg` command.
### Web Searches
None.
### Implementation Notes
No changes required; evidence suggests task conditions already satisfied.
### Validation Evidence
Refer to earlier `rg` audit (no matches) demonstrating absence of deep relative imports in `tests/` TypeScript files.
### Open Follow-ups
None.
