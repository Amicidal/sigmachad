## Task & Definition
- Flush `TODO.md` entries 1 through 11 because they no longer reflect current work.

## Constraints/Risks
- TODO backlog format forbids renumbering normally; removal must avoid destabilizing remaining IDs.
- No tests applicable; ensure no unintended truncation of remaining backlog content.

## Code Searches
- None (task limited to editing `TODO.md`).

## Web Searches
- None.

## Implementation Notes
- Used `python3` script to slice `TODO.md`, removing sections between headings `### 1.` and `### 12.` while preserving the remaining backlog entry.

## Validation Evidence
- Manual inspection of `TODO.md` confirms only entry `### 12.` remains under the backlog.

## Open Follow-ups
- None.
