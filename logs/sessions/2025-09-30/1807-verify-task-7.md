Task & Definition
- Verify TODO.md Task 7 alignment and acceptance. Confirm mcp-server call sites compile and note blockers for smoke run.

Constraints/Risks
- Network restricted; cannot pull/start Neo4j/Postgres/Redis via Docker.
- Nx build compiles dependent packages; unrelated TS errors may fail the run.

Code Searches
- cmd: rg -n "Task 7|^### 7\." TODO.md
  expect: locate Task 7; confirm acceptance and entry points
  result: Task 7 found with entry points and acceptance criteria.
- cmd: rg -n "getRelationships\(|searchEntities\(|getEntityDependencies\(|parseDocumentation\(|syncDocumentation\(" apps/mcp-server/src/main.ts
  expect: find call sites to verify
  result: getRelationships, searchEntities, getEntityDependencies, syncDocumentation present.

Web Searches
- none (offline/restricted)

Implementation Notes
- Adjusted `search_codebase` to pass a typed union for `entityTypes` using GraphSearchRequest types. Replaced `security_scan`â€™s nonexistent `scanPath` with `performScan` and normalized args.
- File: apps/mcp-server/src/main.ts
- Commands run:
  - pnpm nx run mcp-server:build > logs/latest-build-mcp.log 2>&1

Validation Evidence
- Build log: logs/latest-build-mcp.log
- Assertion: No TS errors from apps/mcp-server/src/main.ts call sites post-fix.
- Observation: Workspace build still fails on other packages (APIGateway Fastify augmentation; never[] in knowledge/testing; etc.).

Open Follow-ups
- To fully complete Task 7: run `pnpm dev:mcp` with backing services (Neo4j/Postgres/Redis) up; capture startup evidence and update TODO.md status to Complete.
- Related fixes tracked by Task 8 (Fastify augmentation) and Task 9 (never[] in knowledge/testing) block green workspace builds.
