Task & Definition
- Implement TODO.md Task 26 (Knowledge OGM/API Typing Convergence) [ID: 2025-09-30.13]. Goal: get packages/knowledge to type-check cleanly under src-first aliases and reconcile OGM and API types.

Constraints/Risks
- Monorepo depth/import rules; no deep relative imports. Network restricted. Active dev; prioritize velocity. Session must capture logs and avoid giant outputs.
- Potential ripple across shared-types and graph models; keep diffs focused.

Code Searches
- Pending: inspect knowledge graph services, ISearchService, GraphExamples, models-ogm.

Web Searches
- None (network restricted).

Implementation Notes
- Start by running TypeScript on packages/knowledge and capturing errors.

Validation Evidence
- Will attach path to tsc logs and acceptance checks.

Open Follow-ups
- TBD based on findings.

Task & Definition
- Progress update: Implemented subset of Task 26 (ISearchService type re-exports, OGM helper typings, GDS/Neo4j typing fixes, SearchServiceOGM GraphExamples alignment) to reduce structural TS errors. Remaining ingestion/orchestration mismatches logged as follow-ups.

Constraints/Risks
- Broad typing drift in ingestion/orchestration modules; full convergence is multi-file. Kept diffs focused on Entry Points and added TODO coverage for residuals.

Code Searches
- rg -n "^### 26\." TODO.md → locate task block and acceptance.
- sed -n packages/knowledge/src/graph/*.ts → inspect OGM services.
- rg -n "GraphExamples" packages/shared-types/src → confirm shape & export.
- rg -n "metrics:updated" packages/knowledge/src/ingestion → event payload types.

Implementation Notes
- ISearchService: re-exported Entity/Search types for consumers of @memento/knowledge/ISearchService.
- SearchServiceOGM: removed unknown GraphExamples field, added safer name fallback.
- shared-types: extended GraphExamples with optional relatedPatterns (left unused to avoid downstream drift), kept SearchStats extension.
- GdsService: added nodeQuery/relationshipQuery to config type for graph.create.
- Neo4jService: delegate close() to CypherExecutor.
- PathAnalyzer: relaxed node typing in mock output.
- DocumentationParser: mapped parser enums to shared enums (docType/docIntent).
- Ingestion: normalized events to IngestionEvents (pipeline:error), wrapped queue metrics into PipelineMetrics for metrics:updated.
- WorkerPool: removed duplicate method, default worker type to parser, mapped internal statuses to WorkerMetrics.status.
- CacheManager: replaced ReturnType usage with concrete Map typing to avoid unknown.

Validation Evidence
- Ran: pnpm exec tsc -p packages/knowledge/tsconfig.json --noEmit
  - Log 1: logs/typecheck-knowledge-2025-09-30_0345.log (baseline)
  - Log 2: logs/typecheck-knowledge-2025-09-30_0349-after1.log (post first fixes)
  - Log 3: logs/typecheck-knowledge-2025-09-30_0357-after2.log (post ingestion/worker fixes)
- Observed: OGM/Search-related errors cleared; remaining errors concentrated in ingestion/pipeline/SyncOrchestrator and orchestrator wiring.

Open Follow-ups
- See TODO.md Task 26 follow-up (pending) bullets added in this session.
