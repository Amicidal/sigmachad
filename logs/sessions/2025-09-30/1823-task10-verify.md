Task & Definition
- Verify TODO.md Task 10: "Initialize required properties in HighThroughputIngestionPipeline" is complete per acceptance criteria.

Constraints/Risks
- Network access restricted; local build only.
- Must redirect build output to logs per project convention.

Code Searches
- Command: `sed -n '1,220p' packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/pipeline.ts`
  - Goal: Inspect property declarations and constructor/initializer.
  - Result: Properties use definite assignment (`!`) and are set in `initializeComponents()`.
- Command: `rg -n "class|queueManager|workerPool|batchProcessor|astParser|constructor\(|initializeComponents" packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/pipeline.ts`
  - Goal: Confirm initialization and usages across methods.
  - Result: Set in `initializeComponents()`; used throughout `start/stop` and worker handlers.
- Command: `rg -n "startMonitoring\(|stopMonitoring\(|metricsTimer|healthCheckTimer" packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/pipeline.ts`
  - Goal: Verify timers are started/stopped and cleared safely.
  - Result: `startMonitoring()` sets intervals; `stopMonitoring()` clears and nulls timers.

Web Searches
- None (network restricted; not necessary).

Implementation Notes
- No code changes required; verification only.

Validation Evidence
- Build: `pnpm -r --filter @memento/knowledge build > logs/latest-knowledge-build.log 2>&1`
- Check: `rg -n "TS\d{4}|ERR!|Error:|Failed|fatal" logs/latest-knowledge-build.log`
- Observed: No TypeScript errors; especially none for TS2564.
- File markers:
  - `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/pipeline.ts:62` declares `queueManager!`.
  - `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/pipeline.ts:63` declares `workerPool!`.
  - `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/pipeline.ts:64` declares `batchProcessor!`.
  - `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/pipeline.ts:65` declares `astParser!`.
  - `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/pipeline.ts:404` `initializeComponents()` assigns all four.

Open Follow-ups
- None for Task 10. Consider adding a small unit test to assert `start()` fails if `initializeComponents()` not called, though current constructor guarantees invocation.
