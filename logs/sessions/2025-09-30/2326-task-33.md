Task & Definition
Fix residual security/detect-object-injection warnings in knowledge scripts (Task 33). Target: eliminate the two findings at packages/knowledge/scripts/benchmark-ingestion.ts:376,377 by code change (preferred) or ensure they are non-error via eslint override and rationale.

Constraints/Risks
- Scripts are non-runtime; prefer minimal invasive change.
- Avoid disabling the rule broadly; fix locally to reach 0 occurrences.
- Keep within repo style and path-depth constraints; no package changes.

Code Searches
- cmd: rg -n "Task 33|\\b33\\.|\\[#33\\]|\\bID[: ]?33\\b|^33\\)" TODO.md → locate task entry and acceptance.
- cmd: nl -ba packages/knowledge/scripts/benchmark-ingestion.ts | sed -n '350,410p' → inspect lines 376–377 usage.

Web Searches
- None. Existing repo context sufficient.

Implementation Notes
- Replace bracket indexing with safe `.at(...)` access to avoid computed member access (source of detect-object-injection warnings) and to handle out-of-range indices gracefully.
- Diff (conceptual):
  - latencies[p95Index] || 0 → latencies.at(p95Index) ?? 0
  - latencies[p99Index] || 0 → latencies.at(p99Index) ?? 0

Validation Evidence
- cmd: pnpm -s eslint packages/knowledge/scripts/benchmark-ingestion.ts > logs/latest-lint-task33.log 2>&1
- Assertion: No occurrences of security/detect-object-injection in the log.
- Evidence: grep returned no matches; see logs/latest-lint-task33.log (0 matches for rule; some unrelated warnings/errors remain: 3 no-unused-vars, 9 no-explicit-any as expected for scripts override).

Open Follow-ups
- Optionally tighten script types to reduce no-explicit-any warnings (non-blocking for Task 33).
- Consider downgrading @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars to warn in scripts if noise becomes problematic.
