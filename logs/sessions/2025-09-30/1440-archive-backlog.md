# Session 2025-09-30_1440-archive-backlog

## Task & Definition
- Add a Follow-up note under Task 2 in TODO.md deferring integration test validation to later tasks.
- Archive a full snapshot of all current backlog tasks to logs/todos/2025-09-30.md.

## Constraints/Risks
- Must preserve backlog field order; modify only relevant bullets.
- Archiving all tasks deviates from 'Completed-only' archive rule; done per user instruction.
- Concurrency: other sessions may edit TODO.md; patch made surgical to a single line.
- Monorepo policy: depth limit respected (logs/ directories are within limit).

## Code Searches
- Command: sed -n '1,400p' TODO.md — inspect header and structure.
- Command: rg -n '^### 2\.' TODO.md — locate Task 2 heading (found at line 76).
- Command: sed -n '/^### 2\. Synchronize Integration Tests with Current Codebase/,+40p' TODO.md — review Task 2 block.

## Web Searches
- None.

## Implementation Notes
- Patched TODO.md Follow-up (pending) for Task 2 to add: 'Integration test validation will be addressed in later tasks.'
- Extracted tasks block with awk from '## Task Backlog' to '## General Notes'.
- Created archive: logs/todos/2025-09-30.md with snapshot header and full tasks block.

## Validation Evidence
- File updated: TODO.md (single-line change under Task 2).
- Archive exists: logs/todos/2025-09-30.md (653 lines).
- Grep check: grep -n 'Integration test validation will be addressed in later tasks' TODO.md — returns 1 hit under Task 2.

## Open Follow-ups
- If desired, create explicit follow-up task IDs for integration test validation (e.g., 2025-09-30.x).
- When actual validation evidence is captured, re-archive completed tasks individually with acceptance links.
