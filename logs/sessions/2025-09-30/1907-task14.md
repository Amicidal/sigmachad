Task & Definition
- Implement TODO.md Task 14: Add per-package/app ESLint overrides with parserOptions.project pointing to each local tsconfig to enable typed rules without global project mismatches. Remove global project if needed. Verify lint run has zero “Parsing error: ESLint was configured to run on ... using parserOptions.project” messages.

Constraints/Risks
- Must honor monorepo depth and import rules; avoid expanding config outside scope.
- Tests produce large output; capture lint logs to files.
- Some apps (web, mcp-server) use tsconfig.app.json; ensure correct project paths.
- Current tests override uses tsconfig.test.json which excludes tests; avoid parser errors there.

Code Searches
- rg TODO Task 14 context and file paths.
- Inspect eslint.config.js for global parserOptions.project and existing overrides.
- Enumerate packages/apps and their tsconfig locations.

Web Searches
- None (offline, repo-local task).

Implementation Notes
- Plan to remove global parserOptions.project; add explicit overrides for each package/app src; keep shared-types special case.
- Adjust tests override to avoid project-based typed parser to prevent exclusions from causing parse errors.

Validation Evidence
- Will run: pnpm -s lint > logs/latest-lint.log 2>&1
- Then search for parser errors in log.

Open Follow-ups
- If any package still yields parser errors, add/adjust its override.
