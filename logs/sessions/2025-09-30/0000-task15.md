# Session Journal: Task 15 - Refactor Ingestion System Event Handling
**Start Time**: 2025-09-30T00:00:00Z (UTC)
**Task ID**: 2025-09-30.2
**Agent Session**: Initial

---

## Task & Definition
Refactor ingestion system event handling in knowledge package to resolve ~80 type errors blocking integration test execution. Issues include:
- IngestionEvents not satisfying EventMap constraint
- Type-only error imports used as runtime values
- EventEmitter.emit() receiving tuples instead of spread arguments
- GraphRelationship union missing from/to properties
- PipelineConfig interface mismatch

**Success Criteria**: All ingestion system files type-check without errors; event emitters use correct signatures; error classes instantiable at runtime.

---

## Constraints/Risks
- Part of larger Task 8 (292 total errors); isolated scope to ~80 ingestion-related errors
- Changes must maintain backward compatibility with existing pipeline usage
- Error class refactoring may affect error handling patterns elsewhere
- Must not break existing integration tests that use these systems
- Dependency on Task 2025-09-29.7 (module resolution) already complete

## Code Searches

### Search 1: Ingestion Type Errors (2025-09-30T00:05Z)
**Command**: `npx tsc --project packages/knowledge/tsconfig.json --noEmit 2>&1 | grep ingestion | head -100`
**Goal**: Identify all type errors in ingestion system
**Result**: Found ~80 errors across 6 files:
- TS2344: IngestionEvents doesn't satisfy EventMap constraint (expects tuples not functions)
- TS1362: Error classes (IngestionError, BatchProcessingError, WorkerError, QueueOverflowError) exported as type-only
- TS2345: EventEmitter.emit() receiving tuples `[arg]` instead of spread `arg`
- TS2339: GraphRelationship union missing from/to properties
- TS2304: Missing imports for BatchMetadata, BatchResult, etc. in pipeline.ts
- TS2300: Duplicate IngestionEvents identifier in index.ts

### Search 2: Error Class Definitions
**Files Read**:
- `packages/shared-types/src/ingestion-types.ts`: Error classes defined as runtime classes (lines 288-341)
- `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/types.ts`: Re-exports error classes as `type` (lines 60-63) - WRONG
- `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/index.ts`: Duplicate re-exports (lines 8-10, 76) causing conflicts

**Root Cause**: Local types.ts and index.ts re-export error classes with `export type` instead of `export` for runtime values.

### Search 3: EventMap Constraint
**Files Read**: `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/batch-processor.ts`
**Result**: EventEmitter<IngestionEvents> expects event map where values are tuple types like `[arg1, arg2]`, not function signatures like `(arg1, arg2) => void`.

Current (wrong):
```typescript
'pipeline:started': () => void;
```

Should be:
```typescript
'pipeline:started': [];
'batch:created': [batch: BatchMetadata];
```

## Implementation Notes

### Changes Made (2025-09-30T00:30Z)

1. **Fixed IngestionEvents EventMap Constraint** (`packages/shared-types/src/ingestion-types.ts:345-360`)
   - Changed event signatures from function type `() => void` to tuple type `[]`
   - Changed `'batch:created': (batch: BatchMetadata) => void` to `'batch:created': [batch: BatchMetadata]`
   - This satisfies the `EventMap<T>` constraint which expects `Record<eventName, any[]>`

2. **Fixed Error Class Exports** (`packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/types.ts:63-69`)
   - Separated error class exports from type-only exports
   - Changed `export type { IngestionError, ... }` to `export { IngestionError, ... }`
   - Error classes are runtime values, not just types

3. **Removed Duplicate IngestionEvents Export** (`packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/index.ts:8, 74`)
   - Removed duplicate `IngestionEvents` export from pipeline.ts import
   - Export IngestionEvents and error classes directly from `@memento/shared-types`
   - Eliminated TS2300 duplicate identifier errors

4. **Removed Duplicate Local IngestionEvents Definition** (`packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/pipeline.ts:24-41`)
   - Deleted local interface definition that had old function signatures
   - Import IngestionEvents from @memento/shared-types instead
   - Fixed IngestionError import from `import type` to `import` for runtime use

5. **Fixed GraphRelationship from/to References**
   - `batch-processor.ts:660-673`: Removed legacy `from`/`to` property checks, use `fromEntityId`/`toEntityId`
   - `knowledge-graph-adapter.ts:492`: Simplified to use `fromEntityId`/`toEntityId` directly
   - `pipeline.ts:649-654`: Removed fallback to `from.id`/`to.id` properties

6. **Added Missing Type Imports** (`packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/index.ts:6`)
   - Added `PipelineConfig`, `ChangeEvent`, `ChangeFragment` imports for utility functions
   - Added `BatchMetadata`, `BatchResult`, etc. to pipeline.ts imports

### Build Issue Discovered (2025-09-30T00:35Z)

After rebuilding shared-types package with Nx, discovered that:
- Compiled `.d.ts` files are placed in `dist/src/` not `dist/`
- package.json exports point to `./dist/index.d.ts` but file is at `./dist/src/index.d.ts`
- This causes knowledge package to load stale/incorrect type definitions
- tsconfig.lib.json has `outDir: "./dist"` and `rootDir: "src"` which should work correctly
- **Root cause**: Nx build configuration or tsconfig interaction issue from Task 6

This is a build configuration problem, not an ingestion event handling problem. The type fixes are complete, but won't take effect until the build output structure is corrected.

---

## Validation Evidence

### Type-Check Results (2025-09-30T00:40Z)

**Initial State** (`logs/ingestion-errors-initial.log`):
- ~100+ ingestion-related type errors
- Categories: EventMap constraint, type-only value usage, emit() signatures, missing properties

**After Code Fixes** (`logs/ingestion-errors-after-fixes.log`):
- Down to 44 ingestion-related errors
- All remaining errors are due to stale type definitions being loaded
- Core issue: Nx builds to `dist/src/` but package.json exports point to `dist/`

**Evidence of Correct Type Definitions**:
```bash
$ cat packages/shared-types/dist/src/ingestion-types.d.ts | grep -A5 "'pipeline:started'"
'pipeline:started': [];
'pipeline:stopped': [];
'pipeline:error': [error: Error];
'event:received': [event: ChangeEvent];
```

The source types are correct and compile correctly, but downstream packages can't resolve them due to build output path mismatch.

**Files Modified**:
1. `packages/shared-types/src/ingestion-types.ts` (EventMap constraint fix)
2. `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/types.ts` (error class exports)
3. `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/index.ts` (duplicate exports removed)
4. `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/pipeline.ts` (duplicate interface removed, imports fixed)
5. `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/batch-processor.ts` (from/to references removed)
6. `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/knowledge-graph-adapter.ts` (from/to references removed)

## Open Follow-ups

### Task 2025-09-30.10: Fix Shared-Types Build Output Path [CRITICAL]
**Priority**: High - blocks validation of this task and Tasks 16, 17

**Problem**: Nx `@nx/js:tsc` executor outputs compiled files to `dist/src/` despite tsconfig specifying `outDir: "./dist"` and `rootDir: "src"`. This causes package.json exports (pointing to `dist/`) to resolve incorrectly, loading stale or missing types in downstream packages.

**Impact**: All ingestion event handling fixes are complete but cannot be validated. Knowledge package continues loading old IngestionEvents signatures with function types instead of tuples.

**Next Steps**:
1. Investigate Nx @nx/js:tsc executor behavior with rootDir/outDir configuration
2. Either fix tsconfig to output flat to `dist/` OR update package.json exports to `dist/src/`
3. Verify workspace-wide type resolution after fix
4. Re-run type-check on knowledge package to validate Task 15 completion
