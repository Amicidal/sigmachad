Task & Definition
- Make `@aws-sdk/lib-storage` optional for @memento/backup (continuation of Task 4, ID: 2025-09-30.24) and document behavior.

Constraints/Risks
- Network remains restricted; cannot actually install optional package for runtime verification.
- Keep TypeScript build passing without the optional module.

Code Searches
- Opened `packages/backup/package.json` to relocate dependency under optionalDependencies.
- Verified provider code uses dynamic import with helpful error messages.

Web Searches
- None.

Implementation Notes
- Moved `@aws-sdk/lib-storage` from dependencies to `optionalDependencies` in `packages/backup/package.json`.
- Added `packages/backup/README.md` documenting the optional nature and install command.
- Left minimal ambient declaration `src/aws-sdk-lib-storage.d.ts` to satisfy TS during builds when the module is not installed.

Validation Evidence
- Built package: `pnpm -r --filter @memento/backup build > logs/builds/2025-09-30/1656-backup.log 2>&1`.
- Build succeeded; no TS errors. Log path recorded above.

Open Follow-ups
- When network access is available, install the optional package in environments that require streaming uploads and consider removing the ambient declaration if redundant.
