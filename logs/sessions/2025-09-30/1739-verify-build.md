Task & Definition

- Verify the reported build failure summary (52 TS errors across packages) by running the monorepo build and cross-checking categories, files, and line numbers.

Constraints/Risks

- Network restricted; cannot install deps.
- Must not spam chat with long logs; capture to file.
- Active repo; concurrent changes possible.

Code Searches

- rg 'SecurityScanner' (confirm exports and imports) -> packages/testing/src/index.ts intentionally omits SecurityScanner; apps/* import from @memento/testing.
- rg signatures in KnowledgeGraphService for getRelationships/searchEntities -> requires RelationshipQuery; GraphSearchRequest uses 'entityTypes', not 'type'.
- rg for fastify augmentation file -> packages/api/src/types/fastify.d.ts present.

Web Searches

- None (local verification only).

Implementation Notes

- Ran 'pnpm build' via NX; redirected output to logs/latest-build.log.
- Tailed and grepped the log to match each error category.

Validation Evidence

- Build log: logs/latest-build.log (NX reports Found
