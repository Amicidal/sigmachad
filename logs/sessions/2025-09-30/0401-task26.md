Task & Definition
Continue Task 26: Resolve typing mismatches across knowledge OGM/API; make tsc pass for packages/knowledge under src-first aliases.

Constraints/Risks
- Monorepo depth/import rules; pnpm only; avoid breaking shared-types exports; concurrent sessions may modify files.
- High-volume output must be logged to files (not chat).

Code Searches
- Pending after first typecheck to target error files.

Web Searches
- None (offline).

Implementation Notes
- Initial step: run tsc and capture errors to logs/typecheck-knowledge-2025-09-30_0401.log.

Validation Evidence
- Will reference logs/typecheck-knowledge-2025-09-30_0401.log results and reruns.

Open Follow-ups
- TBD after inspecting errors.

## Update 2025-09-30 04:10 UTC

Task & Definition
Implemented type convergence fixes across knowledge + shared-types; reran tsc until zero errors.

Constraints/Risks
- Kept changes within src-first alias and monorepo depth rules; avoided altering public API beyond optional fields and event names.

Code Searches
- rg for relationship enums/types, GraphSearchRequest, canonicalRelationshipId; inspected SyncOrchestrator, pipeline, PerformanceOptimizer.

Web Searches
- None.

Implementation Notes
- Fixed imports for canonicalRelationshipId to shared-types.
- Mapped docType/docIntent to shared enums; added DocumentationNode.title; normalized relationships and metadata.
- Ingestion: safe metadata merge, correct relationship field names, added EnrichmentTask.metadata, standardized error event name.
- ServiceRegistry ctor arity, VersionManager import cleanup, PerformanceOptimizer return type typing.

Validation Evidence
- Knowledge tsc clean log: logs/typecheck-knowledge-2025-09-30_0409-after4.log

Open Follow-ups
- Follow-up bullets in Task 26 remain (ingestion events, pipeline config refinements, worker metrics mapping). Consider splitting into separate TODOs if prioritized.
