# Session Journal: Verify Task 1 Completion

## Task & Definition
- Verify completion of TODO.md Task 1 [ID: 2025-09-29.1] — Retire FalkorDB legacy command surface in favor of generic graph terminology with backward-compatible aliases.
- Acceptance criteria (from session 2025-09-29_1750-Claude and backlog):
  - Primary APIs use generic graph methods: `graphQuery`, `graphCommand`, `getGraphService`.
  - Legacy `falkordb*` methods preserved as deprecated aliases.
  - Internal code updated in BackupService, test utilities, and scripts to use generic methods.
  - Shared types define generic interfaces/types (`IGraphService`, `GraphQueryResult`) with FalkorDB variants as legacy aliases.
  - Docs updated to reference Neo4j and generic graph terminology.

## Constraints/Risks
- Workspace has additional failing unit tests unrelated to Task 1 semantics (cleanup ordering and argument shape) that may fail focused runs.
- Integration tests still reference legacy aliases by design; planned follow-up tasks handle full migration.

## Code Searches
- Command: rg -n "getGraphService\(|graphQuery\(|graphCommand\(" packages apps scripts tests
  - Evidence of new API usage in: `packages/backup/src/BackupService.ts` (lines 904, 1393, 1738, 2526), `scripts/backfill-*.ts` (lines 225/260, 427/700), unit tests and testing package utilities.
- Command: rg -n "getFalkorDBService\(|falkordb(Query|Command)\(" packages apps scripts tests
  - Remaining legacy usage found in `packages/core` and many tests/integration; acceptable due to backward-compat aliases. Follow-ups exist (Task 2 etc.).

## Web Searches
- None.

## Implementation Notes
- No code changes for verification; read-only audit and focused tests only.

## Validation Evidence
- Files/lines confirming API and deprecated aliases:
  - `packages/database/src/DatabaseService.ts:83-98,349-474` — has `getGraphService`, `graphQuery`, `graphCommand`, and deprecated `getFalkorDBService`, `falkordbQuery`, `falkordbCommand` that delegate.
  - `packages/shared-types/src/database-types.ts:17-47,237-247` — defines `IGraphService`, `GraphQueryResult`, and legacy `IFalkorDBService`/`FalkorDBQueryResult` extending the generics.
  - `packages/shared-types/src/database-service.ts:4-16,26-38` — exposes generic methods and deprecated legacy methods on `IDatabaseService`.
  - `packages/backup/src/BackupService.ts:904,1393,1738,2526` — now calls `getGraphService()`.
  - `scripts/backfill-structural-metadata.ts:225,260` and `scripts/backfill-session-relationships.ts:427,700` — use `graphQuery`/`getGraphService`.
  - Docs updated previously per `logs/sessions/2025-09-29/1750-Claude.md`.
- Focused unit test run (captured): `pnpm vitest --run --reporter=basic tests/unit/services/DatabaseService.test.ts`
  - Log: `logs/latest-test.log`
  - 4 passed, 2 failed. Failures are unrelated to Task 1 API semantics:
    - Postgres `close()` expectation when `initialize()` fails (cleanup ordering)
    - Neo4j `query` called with extra options arg `{ database: undefined }` — test expectations need update for the new signature.

## Open Follow-ups
- See TODO.md items for integration test migration and type checks (Task 2025-09-29.2 and later). Recommend updating the two unit tests to reflect the new `graphQuery` call signature, and to clarify cleanup expectations when a dependency fails during initialize.
- Reference: logs/latest-test.log for raw output.
