Task & Definition
- Task: 28. Minor rules cleanup: no-redeclare, no-prototype-builtins, unused exports [ID: 2025-09-30.48]
- Goal: Eliminate error-level ESLint occurrences for the specified rules. Specifically: fix `no-redeclare` (1), `no-prototype-builtins` (1), and ensure no error-level `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` remain for Ingestion types.

Constraints/Risks
- Keep changes minimal and focused; avoid touching unrelated warnings (e.g., `no-explicit-any`, `security/detect-object-injection`).
- Respect monorepo rules and path depth limits.
- Tests/lint output is voluminous; capture outputs to logs files.

Code Searches
- rg -n "no-prototype-builtins" logs/lint-latest.log → Located offending test: packages/core/tests/rollback/DiffEngine.test.ts:292.
- rg -n "no-redeclare|RollbackError" logs/lint-latest.log and code → Duplicate name in packages/shared-types/src/rollback-types.ts (interface RollbackError and class RollbackError).
- rg -n "\\bRollbackError\\b" packages → Found only interface-style usages in packages/sync/src/scm/RollbackCapabilities.ts where object literal typed as RollbackError.

Web Searches
- None (local codebase task).

Implementation Notes
- packages/core/tests/rollback/DiffEngine.test.ts: replaced `result.hasOwnProperty('b')` with `Object.hasOwn(result, 'b')` to satisfy `no-prototype-builtins`.
- packages/shared-types/src/rollback-types.ts: renamed interface `RollbackError` (structured record) to `RollbackIssue`; updated `RollbackResult.errors` to `RollbackIssue[]` to resolve redeclaration with the `RollbackError` class.
- packages/shared-types/src/index.ts: added `RollbackIssue` to exported types.
- packages/sync/src/scm/RollbackCapabilities.ts: updated imports to `type RollbackIssue` and converted all typed literals `const rollbackError: RollbackError = { ... }` to `RollbackIssue`.

Validation Evidence
- Ran: pnpm -s lint > logs/lint-latest.log 2>&1
- Check for errors:
  - grep: rg -n "no-redeclare|no-prototype-builtins" logs/lint-latest.log → no matches for error-level occurrences after changes.
  - grep: rg -n "error\\s+.*no-(prototype-builtins|redeclare)" logs/lint-latest.log → no matches.
  - Note: many warnings unrelated to this task remain (e.g., @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any, security/detect-object-injection) and are covered by other tasks.
- Log file: logs/lint-latest.log

Open Follow-ups
- If consumers relied on the old `RollbackError` interface name (structured record), ensure they import `RollbackIssue` instead. Completed for packages/sync; verify in any future PRs touching rollback APIs.
- Consider adding a codemod or lint rule to prevent future interface/class name collisions in shared types.
