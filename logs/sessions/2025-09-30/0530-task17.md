# Session Journal: Task 17 - Clean Up Duplicate Type Exports

**Session ID**: 2025-09-30_0530-task17
**Task ID**: 2025-09-30.4
**Started**: 2025-09-30T05:30:00Z
**Completed**: 2025-09-30T05:50:00Z

## Task & Definition

Clean up duplicate type exports in knowledge package causing TS2308 errors. The package had ~11 duplicate export errors where types were being exported multiple times from different sources through barrel exports and explicit re-exports.

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero TS2308 duplicate export errors
- Zero TS2300 duplicate identifier errors
- Clear export hierarchy established
- Knowledge package consumers can import types without ambiguity

## Constraints/Risks

- Must maintain public API surface for backward compatibility
- Must follow monorepo depth rules (use @memento/* aliases)
- Changes limited to export structure only, no implementation changes
- services-index.ts serves as backward compatibility layer and must preserve aliases

## Code Searches

### Initial Error Assessment
```bash
npx tsc --project packages/knowledge/tsconfig.json --noEmit 2>&1 | grep "TS2308" | wc -l
```
**Result**: 11 TS2308 errors found

### Identifying Duplicate Sources
```bash
grep -n "export.*ExportMapEntry\|export.*ResolvedSymbol" packages/knowledge/src/parsing/*.ts packages/knowledge/src/orchestration/CacheManager.ts
```
**Result**: ExportMapEntry and ResolvedSymbol defined in ModuleResolver.ts, re-exported from types.ts and services-index.ts

```bash
grep -n "export.*DependencyAnalysis\|export.*ImpactAnalysis\|export.*PathQuery\|export.*EntityEdgeStats" packages/knowledge/src/analysis/*.ts
```
**Result**: Analysis types defined in BOTH AnalysisService.ts AND individual analyzer files (DependencyAnalyzer, ImpactAnalyzer, PathAnalyzer)

```bash
grep -n "export.*SearchResult\|export.*Entity" packages/knowledge/src/embeddings/*.ts packages/knowledge/src/analysis/*.ts
```
**Result**: SearchResult defined in EmbeddingService.ts and SyncOrchestrator.ts (via docs-parser); Entity defined separately in each analyzer

## Web Searches

None required - all issues were TypeScript compilation errors identifiable through local tooling.

## Implementation Notes

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Analysis Types**: Same interfaces defined in both AnalysisService.ts and individual analyzer files
   - DependencyAnalysis duplicated in AnalysisService.ts and DependencyAnalyzer.ts
   - ImpactAnalysis/ImpactAnalysisRequest duplicated in AnalysisService.ts and ImpactAnalyzer.ts
   - PathQuery duplicated in AnalysisService.ts and PathAnalyzer.ts
   - Entity interface defined separately in 3 files (DependencyAnalyzer, ImpactAnalyzer, PathAnalyzer)

2. **SearchResult Conflicts**: Two different types with same name
   - EmbeddingService.SearchResult (for vector search results)
   - SyncOrchestrator.SearchResult (for documentation search)

3. **Parsing Types Conflicts**: CachedFileInfo, ExportMapEntry, ResolvedSymbol
   - Originally from @memento/shared-types
   - Re-exported through types.ts
   - Re-exported again with aliases in services-index.ts
   - Created TS2300 duplicate identifier errors

### Changes Applied

#### 1. Consolidated Analysis Types (files: DependencyAnalyzer.ts, ImpactAnalyzer.ts, PathAnalyzer.ts)
- Removed duplicate type definitions from individual analyzer files
- Changed to import from AnalysisService.ts (canonical source)
- Changed Entity to import from @memento/shared-types
- Used both `export type { ... }` and `import type { ... }` for proper re-export and local usage

**Example from DependencyAnalyzer.ts**:
```typescript
// BEFORE
export interface Entity { id: string; type: string; ... }
export interface DependencyAnalysis { dependencies: string[]; ... }

// AFTER
import type { Entity } from '@memento/shared-types';
export type { DependencyAnalysis } from './AnalysisService.js';
import type { DependencyAnalysis } from './AnalysisService.js';
```

#### 2. Fixed index.ts Barrel Exports (file: packages/knowledge/src/index.ts)
- Changed from `export *` to explicit exports for parsing modules
- Analysis section: Explicit class and type exports, AnalysisService as canonical source
- Embedding section: Renamed SearchResult types with aliases
  - `SearchResult as EmbeddingSearchResult` from EmbeddingService
  - `SearchResult as DocSearchResult` from DocumentationParser
- Parsing exports: Changed to explicit class exports only (types come from types.ts)

**Key pattern**:
```typescript
// Analysis exports (explicit class exports, types from AnalysisService only)
export { AnalysisService } from './analysis/AnalysisService';
export type {
  ImpactAnalysis,
  ImpactAnalysisRequest,
  DependencyAnalysis,
  PathQuery,
  EntityEdgeStats,
  ImpactMetrics,
  DependencyMetrics,
} from './analysis/AnalysisService';
export { DependencyAnalyzer } from './analysis/DependencyAnalyzer';
export { ImpactAnalyzer } from './analysis/ImpactAnalyzer';
export { PathAnalyzer } from './analysis/PathAnalyzer';
export type { PathResult } from './analysis/PathAnalyzer';
```

#### 3. Fixed services-index.ts Duplicate Identifiers (file: packages/knowledge/src/services-index.ts)
- Removed CachedFileInfo, ExportMapEntry, ResolvedSymbol from types.ts re-export block
- Re-exported these types from @memento/shared-types with aliases to maintain backward compatibility
- Separated ModuleResolverOptions (local type) from shared types (CachedFileInfo, ExportMapEntry, ResolvedSymbol)

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Core types (excluding CachedFileInfo, ExportMapEntry, ResolvedSymbol which are re-exported with aliases below)
export type {
  ParseResult,
  ParseError,
  // ... other types but NOT CachedFileInfo, ExportMapEntry, ResolvedSymbol
} from './types';

// Individual modules for advanced usage
export { CacheManager } from './orchestration/CacheManager';
// Re-export types from shared-types with aliases to avoid conflicts
export type { CachedFileInfo, ExportMapEntry as CacheExportMapEntry } from '@memento/shared-types';

export { ModuleResolver } from './parsing/ModuleResolver';
export type {
  ResolvedSymbol,
  ExportMapEntry as ModuleExportMapEntry,
} from '@memento/shared-types';
export type { ModuleResolverOptions } from './parsing/ModuleResolver';
```

## Validation Evidence

### Final Type-Check Results
```bash
npx tsc --project packages/knowledge/tsconfig.json --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -E "TS2308|TS2300" | wc -l
```
**Result**: 0 errors

Output saved to: `logs/knowledge-typecheck-task17.log`

**Assertion Checked**: Zero TS2308 (duplicate export) and TS2300 (duplicate identifier) errors in knowledge package

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

### Remaining Type Errors (Out of Scope)
The knowledge package still has other type errors (TS6305 shared-types build issues, parser cross-package imports) but these are tracked in other tasks:
- Task 2025-09-30.10: Fix shared-types build output path mismatch
- Task 2025-09-29.9: Fix parser RelationshipBuilder interfaces

These do not affect the duplicate export resolution which is the scope of this task.

## Open Follow-ups

None. Task completed successfully with all acceptance criteria met.

## Summary

Successfully resolved all 11 TS2308 duplicate export errors by:
1. Consolidating analysis type definitions into AnalysisService.ts
2. Converting index.ts from barrel exports to explicit exports with type aliases
3. Fixing services-index.ts to use @memento/shared-types imports with aliases

Clear export hierarchy established:
- **Canonical sources**: AnalysisService.ts for analysis types, @memento/shared-types for parsing types
- **Barrel exports**: Use explicit exports for classes, explicit type exports with aliases for conflicting types
- **Backward compatibility**: services-index.ts maintains aliased re-exports

Knowledge package consumers can now import types without ambiguity.
