Task & Definition
Verify user-provided Analysis Summary: build PASSED for 16 projects; ESLint FAILED with 17 critical errors (2 custom/no-cross-package-type-imports, 15 security/detect-object-injection) and ~2,527 warnings (majority @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any), with specific files/lines cited in sync and backup packages.

Constraints/Risks
- Must use pnpm scripts (Nx under the hood).
- High-volume logs: redirect to files to avoid context overflow.
- Network access restricted; local verification only.
- Concurrency: working tree may change; will diff and rely on logs snapshots.

Code Searches
- Command: rg -n "no-cross-package-type-imports" scripts eslint configs
- Expect: confirm custom rule presence and behavior.
- Result: Found in scripts/eslint-rules/no-cross-package-type-imports.js and referenced by eslint.config.js.

- Command: rg -n "security/detect-object-injection" packages
- Expect: locate common hotspots; understand prior suppressions.
- Result: Multiple occurrences with inline disables in core and others; confirms rule is enabled globally except select overrides.

Web Searches
- None (network restricted).

Implementation Notes
- Plan: 1) Inspect scripts/configs; 2) Run build; 3) Run eslint with text and JSON; 4) Parse counts and verify file/line matches claims; 5) Summarize.
- Logs: builds -> logs/builds/$DATE, lints -> logs/lints/$DATE.

Validation Evidence
- To be filled after running build/lint. Will reference log file paths and extracted counts.

Open Follow-ups
- Create TODOs for critical lint errors:
  - 2025-09-30.53 — Fix cross-package type-only imports in backup and sync.
  - 2025-09-30.54 — Eliminate security/detect-object-injection in @memento/sync.

\nOpen Follow-ups
- If needed, re-run with 'node scripts/run-nx.cjs run-many -t lint --parallel=1 --verbose > logs/lints/2025-09-30/234155-nx-lint-verbose.log 2>&1' for deeper trace.
