# Task & Definition
- Create actionable TODO backlog items to tackle ESLint issues across the monorepo, aligned with repo lint rules and acceptance criteria.

# Constraints/Risks
- Active development; pre-commit enforces full lint and depth checks, so noisy rules block commits.
- Typed-linting misconfiguration causes parser errors that mask true issues.
- Security rule (`security/detect-object-injection`) flags dynamic indexing patterns in ingestion code; refactors must preserve behavior.

# Code Searches
- Command: `pnpm -s lint > logs/latest-lint.log 2>&1`
  - Goal: Capture current lint landscape.
  - Result: Parser errors for `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/task-worker.ts` and `ingestion/error-handler.ts`; many `security/detect-object-injection` errors; assorted `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`.
- Command: `rg -n "Parsing error: ESLint was configured to run on" logs/latest-lint.log`
  - Goal: Confirm typed-linting configuration gaps.
  - Result: Multiple matches under `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/*`.
- Command: `sed -n '1,260p' eslint.config.js`
  - Goal: Inspect existing overrides.
  - Result: Overrides exist for some packages (`database`, `testing`, `knowledge/scripts`, `shared-types`) but not for `knowledge/src` and other packages/apps.

# Web Searches
- None (not required for local lint triage).

# Implementation Notes
- Appended new lint-focused tasks to `TODO.md` under IDs:
  - 2025-09-30.34 (typed-lint coverage), .35 (object-injection triage/refactors), .36 (unused vars cleanup), .37 (import boundaries), .38 (autofix baseline).
- Kept each entry within the enforced backlog template with explicit acceptance criteria referencing logs/commands.

# Validation Evidence
- File: `TODO.md` — appended tasks 14–18 with IDs 2025-09-30.34 to .38.
- Lint baseline logs: `logs/latest-lint.log` (from the earlier triage run) referenced by the tasks' acceptance.

# Open Follow-ups
- Execute task 2025-09-30.34 first to eliminate parser errors; re-run lint and update `logs/latest-lint.log`.
- Decide policy for `security/detect-object-injection` in ingestion code: refactor vs. targeted downgrade; proceed with 2025-09-30.35 accordingly.
- Begin repo-wide `no-unused-vars` cleanup (2025-09-30.36) after typed-lint is stable to avoid churn.
- Address import boundary violations (2025-09-30.37); add any missing path aliases.
- Run autofix baseline and confirm pre-commit passes (2025-09-30.38).
