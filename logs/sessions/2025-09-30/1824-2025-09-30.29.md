Task & Definition
Verify TODO.md task 9: “Resolve never[] array inference across knowledge/testing packages” [ID: 2025-09-30.29]. Acceptance: build @memento/knowledge and @memento/testing without never[] push errors (TS2345/TS2339) at listed locations.

Constraints/Risks
- Network access restricted; rely on existing node_modules.
- Concurrent edits possible; results reflect repo state at 2025-09-30T18:24Z.
- Build only (no backing services needed); capture logs to avoid chat overflow per convention.

Code Searches
- Command: rg -n "^###\s+9\\." TODO.md — Locate task entry. Found at line 187.
- Command: rg -n "error|TS2345|TS2339|never\\[\\]" logs/task9-build.log — Scan build log for target errors. No matches.

Web Searches
- None (not applicable).

Implementation Notes
- Ran: pnpm -r --filter @memento/knowledge --filter @memento/testing build > logs/task9-build.log 2>&1
- Verified exit code 0 and scanned log for TS2345/TS2339/never[] occurrences.

Validation Evidence
- Build log: logs/task9-build.log
- Summary: Both packages compiled successfully via tsc with no TypeScript errors. Grep produced no matches for TS2345/TS2339/never[].

Open Follow-ups
- Consider normalizing Status label from “Completed” to “Complete” to match Status Legend.
- When grooming, archive the validated task to logs/todos/YYYY-MM-DD.md per protocol.
