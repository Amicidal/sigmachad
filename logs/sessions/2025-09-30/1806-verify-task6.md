Task & Definition
Verify TODO.md Task 6 (ID: 2025-09-30.26): Export SecurityScanner from @memento/testing (or update consumers). Confirm acceptance criteria via builds and log evidence.

Constraints/Risks
- Network disabled; local workspace only.
- High-volume output captured to logs per repo convention.

Code Searches
- rg TODO.md heading (line 138) to locate Task 6.
- Inspect packages/testing/src/index.ts to confirm root re-export of SecurityScanner.
- Inspect apps/mcp-server imports for SecurityScanner from @memento/testing.

Web Searches
- None.

Implementation Notes
- Ran Nx builds for testing and mcp-server with tee to persist logs.

Validation Evidence
- Command: pnpm nx run testing:build | tee logs/verify-task6/testing-build.log
  Result: Success (cache hit). See logs/verify-task6/testing-build.log
- Command: pnpm nx run mcp-server:build | tee logs/verify-task6/mcp-server-build.log
  Result: Build failed on unrelated TS errors, but no TS2305 about SecurityScanner export. Evidence: rg found 0 matches for 'TS2305' and 'SecurityScanner.*is not exported' in logs/verify-task6/mcp-server-build.log

Open Follow-ups
- None for Task 6; other TS errors correspond to Tasks 7â€“8.
