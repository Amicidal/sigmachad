Task & Definition
Verify reported build/lint status and error categories by running root scripts (pnpm build, pnpm lint). Capture logs and summarize findings.

Constraints/Risks
- Network restricted; rely on existing node_modules. - High-volume lint output; redirect to logs. - Monorepo via Nx; use root scripts. - Keep within path depth limits.

Code Searches
1) cat package.json scripts — confirm build/lint entry points (observed).

Implementation Notes
Will run 'pnpm build' and 'pnpm lint' with full output redirected to logs/build-latest.log and logs/lint-latest.log respectively. Capture exit codes for verification.

Validation Evidence
- Build command: pnpm -s build -> exit 0 (log: logs/build-latest.log)
- Lint command: pnpm -s lint -> exit 1 (log: logs/lint-latest.log)

Implementation Notes
- Commands: `pnpm -s build` -> logs/build-latest.log; `pnpm -s lint` -> logs/lint-latest.log
- Parsed lint log to count error-level findings by rule; verified sample locations in api routes and middleware.

Validation Evidence
- Build: PASS (exit 0). Nx built 16 projects; vite built web app. See logs/build-latest.log
- Lint: FAIL (exit 1). Projects linted: api, core, database, graph, knowledge, memento, shared-types, testing.
- Projects with errors: api, core, database, knowledge, shared-types, testing (6 total).
- Error counts (error-severity only):
  - no-empty: 105
  - security/detect-object-injection: 41 (26 Generic, 8 Variable Assigned, 7 Function Call)
  - no-case-declarations: 16
  - no-useless-escape: 18 (primary: packages/api/src/middleware/validation.ts:217)
  - no-undef: 24 (URL, AbortController, ComponentValidation x10, RestoreResult x3, PostgresColumnDefinition x3, PostgresBackupArtifact x3, RestoreIntegrityCheck x1, PostgresTableDump x1, BackupIntegrityResult x1)
  - no-redeclare: 1
  - no-prototype-builtins: 1
  - @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars: 4 (IngestionEvents x2, BatchResult x1, BatchProcessingError x1)
- Total error-level findings: 210

Open Follow-ups
- Decide whether to disable core `no-undef` for TS files in flat config, and add Node 18 globals (URL, AbortController) to `globals`.
- Add `lint` targets to packages without one (backup, parser, sync, agents, jobs, utils) if we want Nx to lint them.
- Address `no-empty` by adding comments or minimal handling to empty blocks.
- Review security/detect-object-injection occurrences and justify/guard dynamic property accesses.
Open Follow-ups
- Added TODO items:
  - 2025-09-30.43 — ESLint TS no-undef + Node 18 globals
  - 2025-09-30.44 — Eliminate empty block statements
  - 2025-09-30.45 — Wrap switch case lexical declarations
  - 2025-09-30.46 — Remove unnecessary escapes
  - 2025-09-30.47 — Add Nx lint targets for missing projects
  - 2025-09-30.48 — Minor rules cleanup (no-redeclare, hasOwn, unused exports)
  - 2025-09-30.49 — Resolve security/detect-object-injection in API routes/graph
