Task & Definition
- Task 29: Resolve security/detect-object-injection in API routes and Graph search. Remove dynamic property access in admin/docs/graph routes, or guard with validated selectors. Acceptance: pnpm -s lint shows 0 error-level for this rule in the listed files; update Task 22 note if needed.

Constraints/Risks
- Lint output is large; must redirect to logs. Avoid broad disables; prefer explicit guards or Maps. Ensure no behavioral change to routing/signatures.

Code Searches
- rg -n "GRAPH_ENTITY_TYPE_LOOKUP|GRAPH_SYMBOL_KIND_LOOKUP" packages/api/src/routes/graph.ts → confirm lookup usage lines 1145–1149; definitions near top.
- nl -ba packages/api/src/routes/admin.ts (lines 97–107) → dynamic (app as any)[method].
- sed -n 330,390p packages/api/src/routes/docs.ts → dynamic docParser method call at line ~375.

Web Searches
- None (local rule enforcement and code changes only).

Implementation Notes
- admin.ts: replaced dynamic (app as any)[method] with switch on method and direct Fastify calls.
- docs.ts: replaced reflective call with explicit parsePlaintext/parseMarkdown selection; default to markdown for unsupported types (e.g., html).
- graph.ts: converted lookup objects to Map<string,string> and used .get() with fallbacks; removed bracket indexing of untrusted key.

Validation Evidence
- Will run: pnpm -s lint > logs/latest-lint.log 2>&1 and grep for security/detect-object-injection occurrences in the three files to confirm 0 errors.

Open Follow-ups
- If other instances remain elsewhere (41 indicated), track under Task 22 or create follow-on tasks. Update TODO.md statuses upon successful lint.

Validation Evidence
- Ran: pnpm -s lint > logs/latest-lint.log 2>&1
- Check: No error-level security/detect-object-injection in target files (searched logs/latest-lint.log for those file paths and rule).
- Scoped ESLint: ./node_modules/.bin/eslint packages/api/src/routes/{admin,docs,graph}.ts -f json -o logs/eslint-task29.json
- Assertion: logs/eslint-task29.json contains zero messages with ruleId=security/detect-object-injection & severity=2 (see NO_ERROR summary).
