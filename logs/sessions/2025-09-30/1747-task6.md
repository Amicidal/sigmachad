Task & Definition
- Complete TODO.md Task 6 – Export SecurityScanner from @memento/testing (ID: 2025-09-30.26). Implement Option A by re-exporting SecurityScanner from the testing package root and verify builds. Update backlog and archive with evidence.

Constraints/Risks
- Nx build for mcp-server compiles dependent packages and currently fails on unrelated TypeScript errors (e.g., never[] inference, nullability in SpecService, temporal storage). Acceptance only requires removal of TS2305 for SecurityScanner and a successful standalone build of @memento/testing.
- Network access restricted; rely on local workspace and pnpm cache.

Code Searches
- cmd: `sed -n '130,160p' TODO.md` — Identify Task 6 scope and acceptance.
- cmd: `sed -n '1,200p' packages/testing/src/index.ts` — Confirm security exports intentionally omitted.
- cmd: `sed -n '1,200p' packages/testing/src/security/index.ts` — Verify SecurityScanner export path.
- cmd: `sed -n '1,60p' apps/mcp-server/src/{api-server.ts,main.ts}` — Confirm imports from '@memento/testing'.
- result: SecurityScanner exported from `packages/testing/src/security/index.ts`; not present in root index.ts, causing TS2305 in consumer apps.

Web Searches
- None required.

Implementation Notes
- Change: Add `export { SecurityScanner } from './security/index.js';` to `packages/testing/src/index.ts` to expose SecurityScanner at the root entrypoint.
- Rationale: Stabilizes `@memento/testing` API for app imports without adding subpath complexity or exports mapping changes (Option A per TODO).

Validation Evidence
- cmd: `pnpm -r --filter @memento/testing build > logs/builds/2025-09-30/1744-testing-build.log 2>&1`
- assert: Build completes with exit code 0 (no TS errors). Evidence: logs/builds/2025-09-30/1744-testing-build.log
- cmd: `node scripts/run-nx.cjs build mcp-server > logs/builds/2025-09-30/1744-mcp-build.log 2>&1`
- assert: Log has no TS2305 mentioning SecurityScanner export from '@memento/testing'. Search: `rg -n "TS2305|SecurityScanner.*is not exported" logs/builds/2025-09-30/1744-mcp-build.log` returned no matches. Other unrelated TS errors remain (expected per backlog tasks 7–10).
- Backlog updates: TODO.md Task 6 status set to Complete; archival copy created at logs/todos/2025-09-30.md with evidence links.

Open Follow-ups
- None for Task 6. Related cleanup tracked separately (Tasks 7–10 cover MCP API alignment, Fastify augmentation, and never[] inferences).
