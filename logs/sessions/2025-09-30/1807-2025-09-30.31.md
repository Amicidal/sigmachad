Task & Definition
Normalize Date/nullability for symbol/doc nodes and SpecService serialization [ID: 2025-09-30.31]. Fix TS2322/TS18048 by ensuring File/Symbol entities have concrete Date fields and SpecService serialization guards dates.

Constraints/Risks
- Monorepo rules: keep depth <=3, avoid cross-package churn.
- Types are shared via @memento/shared-types; avoid broad type changes to limit blast radius.
- Network restricted; only local builds allowed.

- Command: nl -ba packages/testing/src/SpecService.ts | sed -n '1,120p' and '360,560p' — identify toISOString() sites at lines 59, 104, 473, 475.

- None (network disabled and not required for local type fixes).

Implementation Notes
- packages/knowledge/src/parsing/SymbolExtractor.ts
  - Normalize dates: derive `created` and `lastModified` via nullish coalescing with `new Date()` in base symbol and JS entity creators.
- packages/knowledge/src/parsing/ASTParser.ts
  - Normalize dates for base symbol and JS entity creators similarly.
- packages/sync/src/scm/ConflictResolution.ts
  - Default `ManualOverrideRecord.timestamp` to `new Date()` and `resolvedBy` to 'unknown' when absent.
- packages/testing/src/SpecService.ts
  - Wrap DB writes and serializeSpec with `ensureDate(...).toISOString()` for created/updated/lastModified.
- TODO.md
  - Mark task 11 status to Complete per acceptance.
- Archive
  - Added entry to logs/todos/2025-09-30.md with evidence links.

Validation Evidence
- Build Command: pnpm -r --filter @memento/knowledge --filter @memento/sync --filter @memento/testing build > logs/latest-build.log 2>&1
- Result: All three builds completed successfully; no TS2322/TS18048 at referenced lines.
- Log: logs/latest-build.log

Open Follow-ups
- Consider centralizing an `ensureDate` helper in a shared utility to reduce duplication across packages.
- Audit additional entity creators to ensure `created`/`lastModified` are always set.
