Task & Definition
- Implement Task 24: Expose getSearchStats via KnowledgeGraphService and Wire API. Extend SearchStats to include totalSearches and averageResponseTime; add pass-throughs in SearchManager and KnowledgeGraphService; update /api/vdb/stats to return real metrics.

Constraints/Risks
- Monorepo rules (depth/import limits) must be observed.
- Shared types change may ripple; keep additions backward-compatible (additive fields only).
- Ensure API compiles without circular deps; SearchManager currently imports types from @memento/core.

Code Searches
- rg -n "task 24" TODO.md → Found spec at lines 456–472 with entry points and acceptance.
- sed -n packages/knowledge/src/orchestration/KnowledgeGraphService.ts → No getSearchStats currently.
- sed -n packages/graph/src/facades/SearchManager.ts → No getSearchStats; SearchService interface lacks it.
- sed -n packages/knowledge/src/graph/SearchServiceOGM.ts → has getSearchStats but placeholder fields.
- sed -n packages/shared-types/src/search-types.ts → SearchStats lacks totalSearches, averageResponseTime.
- sed -n packages/api/src/routes/vdb.ts → /stats route returns placeholder searchStats.

Implementation Notes
- Plan: (1) Extend SearchStats in shared-types with optional totalSearches, averageResponseTime. (2) Add counters in SearchServiceOGM: track totalSearches and rolling durations (last 100). (3) Update getSearchStats in SearchServiceOGM to include new fields. (4) Add getSearchStats to SearchManager interface and class; delegate to underlying service. (5) Add getSearchStats method to KnowledgeGraphService delegating to SearchManager. (6) Update /api/vdb/stats to use kgService.getSearchStats(). Add inline comment describing metrics.

Validation Evidence
- Commands executed:
  - `pnpm exec tsc -p packages/shared-types/tsconfig.lib.json --noEmit` → OK (see logs/typecheck-shared-types.log)
  - `pnpm exec tsc -p packages/shared-types/tsconfig.lib.json` → emitted to packages/shared-types/dist (search-types.d.ts updated)
  - `pnpm exec tsc -p packages/core/tsconfig.json` → emitted to packages/core/dist (index.js present; d.ts partial per existing config)
  - `pnpm exec tsc -p packages/graph/tsconfig.json --noEmit` → FAILED with TS6305 due to project references expecting core d.ts (pre-existing). See logs/typecheck-graph.log.
  - Nx workspace build attempts were blocked by sandbox: see logs/latest-build.log. Requesting approval to run with escalated permissions if full build is desired.

  Assertions checked:
  - SearchServiceOGM#getSearchStats now returns shape with `totalSearches` and `averageResponseTime` and updates counters on both cache hits and misses.
  - KnowledgeGraphService exposes `getSearchStats()` and API `/api/vdb/stats` returns real metrics from service.
  - Grep shows all callsites wired: `rg -n "getSearchStats\(" packages` → API, graph facade, knowledge service, OGM service.

Open Follow-ups
- Consider persisting topSearches and hit-rate tracking across restarts.
- Add unit tests for SearchServiceOGM stats accumulation (if test scaffolding for OGM exists). 
- Resolve TS6305 by ensuring @memento/core emits full `.d.ts` (including `index.d.ts`) or adjust project references; see logs/typecheck-graph.log. Suggest running `pnpm -w build` (requires sandbox approval) or updating core tsconfig to guarantee declaration output.
