Task & Definition
- Implement TODO.md Task 10 (ID 2025-09-30.30): Initialize required properties in HighThroughputIngestionPipeline to resolve TS2564 for `queueManager`, `workerPool`, `batchProcessor`, `astParser` in `packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/pipeline.ts`.

Constraints/Risks
- Must adhere to repo depth/import rules; minimize code churn (KISS).
- Strict TS config (`strictPropertyInitialization`) triggers TS2564; fix must be safe and obvious.
- Avoid introducing optional types that require guards across many call sites.

Code Searches
- Opened: packages/knowledge/src/ingestion/pipeline.ts to inspect field declarations and constructor.
- Observed: Fields assigned within `initializeComponents()` called from constructor; TS cannot infer that for definite initialization.

Web Searches
- None (not required; local code change).

Implementation Notes
- Applied definite assignment assertions (`!`) on the four fields with a clarifying comment.
- Rationale: Components are assigned synchronously in `initializeComponents()` invoked inside the constructor; `!` communicates that guarantee without broad refactors.

Validation Evidence
- Run: pnpm -r --filter @memento/knowledge build > logs/latest-build.log 2>&1
- Assert: No TS2564 errors referencing `pipeline.ts`.

Open Follow-ups
- None at this time; consider future refactor to direct constructor assignments if desired.
