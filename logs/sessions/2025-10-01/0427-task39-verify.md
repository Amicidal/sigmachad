Task & Definition
-----------------
- Verify TODO.md Task 39: "Align unit tests with current APIs and error shapes" [ID: 2025-10-01.4].
- Run the targeted unit tests as specified under Acceptance, capture logs, and determine pass/fail status. Provide artifacts and note any discrepancies.

Constraints/Risks
-----------------
- Local run only; network access is restricted. Must redirect noisy test output to files per repo convention.
- Globs in Acceptance may expand beyond the originally intended three files, changing outcomes.
- Concurrent agent edits may affect tests; baselined against current HEAD at run time.

Code Searches
-------------
- Command: rg -n "^### +39\\." TODO.md
  - Expectation: locate Task 39 section and Acceptance criteria.
  - Result: Found at line ~658 with Acceptance globs.
- Command: ls tests/unit/services
  - Expectation: see which files match ASTParser*.test.ts and SecurityScanner*.test.ts.
  - Result: Multiple matches including SecurityScanner.issues-suppression.test.ts in addition to SecurityScanner.test.ts.

Web Searches
------------
- None (not required).

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Ran targeted globs per Acceptance:
  - Command: pnpm -s vitest run tests/unit/services/ASTParser*.test.ts tests/unit/services/SecurityScanner*.test.ts tests/unit/api/mcp-router.test.ts > logs/latest-task39-verify.log 2>&1
  - Outcome: exit code 1; 7 files failed, 13 tests failed. Representative failure: SecurityScanner.issues-suppression.test.ts → "Test had zero assertions" (thrown by tests/setup.ts assertion guard).
- Re-ran with strict three-file selection (likely intended scope):
  - Command: pnpm -s vitest run tests/unit/services/ASTParser.test.ts tests/unit/services/SecurityScanner.test.ts tests/unit/api/mcp-router.test.ts > logs/latest-task39-verify-strict.log 2>&1
  - Outcome: exit code 0; 3/3 files passed, 132/132 tests passed. Some stderr logging observed but tests green.
- Compared against prior artifact:
  - logs/latest-task39-targeted-final.log shows 3/3 passed earlier as well.

Validation Evidence
-------------------
- logs/latest-task39-verify.log
  - Summary: exit 1; Test Files 7 failed | 3 passed (10); Tests 13 failed | 133 passed (146). Example failure: SecurityScanner.issues-suppression.test.ts → zero assertions.
- logs/latest-task39-verify-strict.log
  - Summary: exit 0; Test Files 3 passed (3); Tests 132 passed (132). Matches Acceptance if interpreted as exactly those three files.
- logs/latest-task39-targeted-final.log
  - Summary: exit 0; Test Files 3 passed (3); Tests 132 passed (132). Prior run artifact referenced in TODO.md.

Open Follow-ups
---------------
- Clarify Acceptance to explicitly list the three files (ASTParser.test.ts, SecurityScanner.test.ts, tests/unit/api/mcp-router.test.ts) or expand scope to include all SecurityScanner* tests.
- If expanded, fix SecurityScanner.issues-suppression.test.ts (add assertions consistent with current error-shape behavior) or skip/move under integration if it relies on behavior outside unit scope.
- Optionally update TODO.md Task 39 status to "In Progress" given failures under globbed selection; leave as "Complete" if Acceptance is interpreted narrowly.
