Task & Definition
- Verify if linting errors remain in the repository by running the Nx lint target via pnpm and summarizing results.

Constraints/Risks
- Network access restricted; cannot install missing deps.
- Lint output can be high volume; capture to file to preserve context.

Code Searches
- rg -n "\b(lint|eslint)\b" package.json project.json apps packages scripts
  Expect: find lint scripts and Nx executor usage.
  Result: Found root scripts (pnpm lint) and @nx/eslint:lint targets for projects.

Web Searches
- None.

Implementation Notes
- Ran: `pnpm -s lint > logs/lint-latest.log 2>&1; echo $?>logs/.lint-exit-code`.
- Parsed clean log with ANSI stripped for quick error scan.

Validation Evidence
- Log: logs/lint-latest.log
- Exit code: 1 (from logs/.lint-exit-code)
- Failed tasks: api:lint, knowledge:lint (observed in tail).
- Errors found (examples):
  - packages/api/src/mcp-router.ts:1635:24 security/detect-object-injection
  - packages/knowledge/scripts/benchmark-ingestion.ts:16:8 @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
  - packages/knowledge/scripts/benchmark-ingestion.ts:19:3 @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
  - packages/knowledge/scripts/benchmark-ingestion.ts:20:3 @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
  - packages/knowledge/scripts/demo-ingestion-pipeline.ts:10:8 @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
- Warnings summary lines observed (24 occurrences), totaling 3472 warnings across multiple projects.

Open Follow-ups
- Decide whether to: (a) fix the 5 erroring lines above, or (b) relax rule severities for scripts if intentional.
- If desired, run `pnpm lint:fix` to auto-fix eligible warnings, then re-run lint and capture new log.
\n---
Task & Definition
- Updated eslint.config.js to set no-unused-vars to 'warn' for packages/knowledge/scripts/**/*.ts and reran lint.
\nImplementation Notes
- File changed: eslint.config.js (knowledge scripts override).
- Reran: pnpm lint -> logs/lint-after-warn.log; still failing for api and knowledge.
- Direct ESLint runs to isolate:
  - pnpm exec eslint packages/knowledge/**/*.ts -> 31 errors (19 security/detect-object-injection, 12 no-case-declarations).
  - pnpm exec eslint packages/api/**/*.ts -> 10 errors (security/detect-object-injection).
\nValidation Evidence
- logs/lint-after-warn.log (exit 1)
- logs/eslint-knowledge-cli.log (exit 1)
- logs/eslint-api-cli.log (exit 1)
