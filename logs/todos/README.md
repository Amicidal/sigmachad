# TODO Archive Index

- Store completed task entries here using files named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (UTC date when the task was finished).
- Paste the task block exactly as it appeared in `TODO.md`, change `- **Status**:` to `Complete`, and append a bullet for evidence links (session logs, PRs, etc.).
- Do not edit historical files once committed; append new completions to the same date file if multiple tasks finish on that day.
- Keep this README updated with a short index whenever you add a new archive file.
