# Scratch Directory

This directory is for unstructured, free-form documentation that doesn't need to follow any standards.

## What goes here?

- Draft documents
- Meeting notes
- Brainstorming sessions
- Temporary documentation
- Work-in-progress ideas
- Personal notes
- Experimental content
- Quick references
- Code snippets for testing

## Rules

**There are NO rules here!**

This directory is completely exempt from:
- File naming conventions
- Frontmatter requirements
- Section structure requirements
- Markdown formatting rules
- Linting and validation

Feel free to:
- Use any file naming you want
- Write in any format you prefer
- Create subdirectories as needed
- Leave work unfinished
- Include TODO/FIXME comments
- Use any markdown style

## Important

- Files here are NOT validated by the documentation linter
- Content here should be considered temporary or draft
- Once content is ready, move it to the appropriate structured directory
- This directory is version controlled, so sensitive information should still be avoided
