### Project Memento

    The goal of Memento is to create an agent-first MCP server for AI coding agents so they have full awareness of the changes they intend to make and have made. It builds a knowledge graph over the codebase and uses a vector index to prevent context drift and code quality issues. It acts as a validation gate to ensure quality and prevent current and future technical debt.  The development lifecycle should go from Docs -> Tests -> Implementation

### Problems to solve
    Pre-Tool
        - Agents tend to reimplement instead of reusing existing code.
        - Finding and selecting implementations via multi-hop grep wastes tokens and misses edge cases.
        - Incorrect API usage (wrong args/order, hallucinated options).
        - Little consideration for current architecture/policies due to massive token wastage of searching every time. 

    Post-Tool
        - Codebase state changes make docs/imports stale; cascades across files.
        - Partial updates leave inconsistencies that arenâ€™t caught.
        - No validation via static tools or agent driven self-reflection that changes align with architecture/policies.
        - Coding Agents can be incredibly deceptive in that they constantly create mocks or simplified versions of intended sophisticated implementations that breaks everything. 
        
   
### Architecture
    Language: TypeScript (Node.js)
    Graph Database: FalkorDB
    Vector Database: Qdrant
    Orchestration: Docker Compose

### Lifecycle Gates
    Overview: Docs -> Tests -> Implementation -> Validation -> Impact -> Commit
    Docs
        - Spec must include title, goals, acceptance criteria.
        - Stored with ID; linked to all subsequent changes.
    Tests
        - Generate or update tests from the spec; initially failing is acceptable.
        - Enforce minimum changed-lines coverage threshold (configurable).
    Implementation
        - Propose diffs only after spec and tests exist.
        - Prefer reuse via graph and examples; block stubs/simplified mocks.
        - Respect architecture and policy constraints.
    Validation
        - TypeScript type-check, ESLint, security lint.
        - Architecture policy engine (layering, banned imports/deps).
        - All tests must pass; coverage threshold must be met.
    Impact
        - Update knowledge graph and vector index after accepted diffs.
        - Detect stale imports/exports/re-exports and propose follow-up edits.
    Commit
        - Create branch/commit/PR with links to spec, tests, and validation report.

### Graph Schema
    Entities
        - File, Directory, Module/Package, Symbol, Function, Class, Interface, TypeAlias, Test, Doc
    Edges
        - imports, exports, re-exports, defines, declares, calls, references, implements, extends, tested-by, belongs-to
    Properties
        - path, hash, language, signature, docstring, lastModified, owningModule, coverage

### Tooling API
    Exposed as an MCP server (Claude Code) and mirrored via HTTP function-calls (OpenAI).
    Tools
        - design.create_spec: Create/validate a feature spec; returns spec ID and acceptance criteria.
        - tests.plan_and_generate: Generate/update tests for a spec; returns changed files.
        - graph.search: Path/usage queries over symbols/APIs; finds reuse candidates.
        - graph.examples: Canonical usages and tests for an API, with signatures and arg order.
        - code.propose_diff: Stage edits as diffs; returns affected graph nodes.
        - validate.run: Run type-check, lint, policy checks, security lint, tests, coverage.
        - impact.analyze: Cascade analysis for stale imports/exports; propose consistency edits.
        - vdb.search: Semantic retrieval joined to graph nodes.
        - scm.commit_pr: Create branch/commit/PR with links to spec/tests/validation.

### Validation Policy
    Configuration file: memento.yaml
        - layers: allowed import directions; banned cross-layer imports.
        - bannedDependencies: disallowed packages or paths.
        - coverageMin: overall and changed-lines thresholds.
        - forbiddenPatterns: e.g., TODO returns, throw new Error('Not Implemented').
        - security: basic dependency and code-level checks.
        - docTemplate/testTemplate: shared templates for spec and test generation.
    Enforcement
        - Block direct file edits unless prior gates pass.
        - Reject diffs that reduce coverage below threshold or violate architecture.

### Integration Guides
    Claude Code (MCP)
        - Register Memento as an MCP server; tools listed above.
        - Enforce step order in system prompt; refuse direct edits until spec+tests exist.
        - On violations, reply with next required tool invocation.
    OpenAI Tools (Assistants)
        - Mirror MCP tools via HTTP function-calls; identical names/schemas.
        - Use tool-calling flow to enforce gates; server rejects out-of-order actions.
        - Return actionable errors pointing to the next required step.

### Implementation Notes
    Indexing
        - TypeScript-first via ts-morph for precise symbols/types.
        - Polyglot path via tree-sitter/LSP adapters.
    Storage
        - Graph: FalkorDB; Vector: Qdrant with metadata keyed to graph node IDs.
    Ops
        - Docker Compose services: memento, falkordb, qdrant.
        - File watcher to resync graph/vector on file changes.
        - CLI: memento validate, memento impact.

### Key Behaviors and Anti-Deception
    Pre-Tool
        - Favor reuse with graph.search and graph.examples; prevent hallucinated options via signature checks.
        - Replace multi-hop grep with path queries through the graph.
    Post-Tool
        - Auto graph/vector sync on accepted diffs.
        - Consistency sweep for stale imports/exports; propose follow-ups via impact.analyze.
    Anti-Deception Heuristics
        - Detect trivial or stub implementations and block merging.
        - Require changed-lines coverage and diff-linked tests.
