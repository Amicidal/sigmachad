# Security Relationships Blueprint

## Metadata

- Scope: security
- Status: Draft
- Last Updated: 2025-09-27

## Working TODO

- [ ] Add/update Scope metadata (Scope: security).
- [ ] Confirm Desired Capabilities with acceptance tests.
- [ ] Link to code touchpoints (packages/, api routes).
- [ ] Add migration/backfill plan if needed.

## Desired Capabilities

- [ ] Define required capabilities and acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Note API/Graph impacts.

## 1. Overview
Security is handled via metadata on core entities (e.g., vulnerabilities array on File/Symbol) appended from external scans (Snyk, ESLint-security). No dedicated KG nodes/edges to avoid bloatâ€”query metadata for quick checks, fix criticals via gates. Offload full reports to Postgres/Redis for audits.

## 2. Implementation Approach
- Ingest: During sync, run scans and merge into `entity.metadata.vulnerabilities`.
- Query: `WHERE entity.metadata.vulnerabilities.severity = 'critical'`.
- Future: If multi-agent audits need traversals, add lightweight edges; else, keep external.

## 3. Current Status
This blueprint is intentionally lightweight to align with velocity focus. No detailed schema or queries are needed at this time.
